# IDP Resources

Resources for Intermediate Data Programming @ North Creek High School

These resources will be available to you for every homework assignment, and at any time you need. They will be in this repository as markdown (`.md`) files. There are folders separating out the files based on general topics.

It will likely be useful for review, assignments, and quiz/exam preparation. 

Here is a list of the current files available, along with a description:
- [collections.md](collections) (a 'cheatsheet' for methods on lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples)
- [pandas_df.md](pandas_df) (a guide on various methods on DataFrames in the Pandas library)
- [f-strings.md](f-strings) (a guide on formatted strings)
- [method_args.md](method_args) (a guide on `*args` and `**kwargs`)
- [writing_comments.md](writing_comments) (a guide for how to write good inline and docstring comments for your methods - **useful for homeworks**)
- [flake8.md](flake8) (an explanation on the flake8 extension, and the rules turned off)


If you have any suggestions you can submit a student request.
