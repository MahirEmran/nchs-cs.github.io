![Final Project](/static/idp_final_project.png)

Embark on a journey where you'll harness your data programming prowess to transform raw data into compelling narratives. `Your mission`: select a dataset that intrigues you, meticulously organize and analyze it, and craft insightful visualizations that tell its story. This project culminates in a presentation where you'll showcase your findings, demonstrating the powerful insights that effective data programming can unveil.

> **IMPORTANT**: You may **NOT** reuse work that you may have done for another class or club. For example, you cannot take your Data Science project done for **TSA**. Everything must be new.  

## Summary

During this Final Project you will have four dates to deliver the following items. This is an overview of the deliverables at the various stages of your Final Project.

1. (20 pts)[Discovery Document and Raw Data ](discovery.md))
2. (30 pts)[Data Organization](organize.md) - Sketches of plots, Reduced Data, Starter Code
3. (30 pts)[Final Code & Research Document](final.md)
4. (20 pts) [Challenge Tasks](challenges.md) -Due with #2 and/or #3
5. (15 pts)[Final Presentation](presentation.md)

[Project Tips](idp/final-project/tips/index.md)

## #1: Discovery Document  

You will deliver the following data organization [here](organize.md)
* A Google Document (described [here](discovery.md)).
* A Link to a Google Share that holds all your raw DATA. The link will be in the document.

## #2: Data Organization  

You will deliver the following:  
* Reduced and partially organized dataset uploaded to `GitHub`  
* Code that partially organizes the data   
* Sketches of target plots  
* Perhaps some Unit Tests (Challenge Goal)  
* Perhaps Web Scraped data or data downloaded via API (Challenge Goal)  

## #3: Final Report

You will deliver a polished research document as described [here](final.md). The document will focus on the plots and the insights they provide.  

## #4 Challenge Tasks  

The details for these are listed in the Discovery Document.    

You will implement and deliver these either with the `Data Organization` or `Final Code and Report` deliverable.  

## #5: Final Presentation
The [Final Presentation](presentation.md) will be your **story**--a verbal presentation of your Data Science results colored by your subjective journey through the project. You will introduce your research topic, provide context and goals. In short, show plots and explain the results. You will have a slide deck that is almost exclusively a collection of the plots that tell a story.
