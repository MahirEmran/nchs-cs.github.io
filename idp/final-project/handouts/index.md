# Intermediate Data Programming
{: .no_toc }

Embark on a journey where you'll harness your data programming prowess to transform raw data into compelling narratives. ***Your mission***: select a dataset that intrigues you, meticulously organize and analyze it, and craft insightful visualizations that tell its story. This project culminates in a presentation where you'll showcase your findings, demonstrating the powerful insights that effective data programming can unveil.

{: .notice }
**IMPORTANT**: You may **NOT** reuse work that you may have done for another class or club. For example, you cannot take your Data Science project done for **TSA**. Everything must be new.

## #1: [Discovery Document and Raw Data](discovery)

You will deliver your initial proposed project and scope.

* A Google Document.
* Your GitHub of your raw_data (or link to data > 1GB)

## #2: [Data Organization](organize)

You will deliver the following:  

* Reduced and partially organized dataset uploaded to `GitHub`
* Code that partially organizes the data   
* Sketches of target plots  
* Perhaps some Unit Tests (Challenge Goal)  
* Perhaps Web Scraped data or data downloaded via API (Challenge Goal)

## #3: [Final Code & Research Document](final)

You will deliver your final code in GitHub using the original starting project provided to you in class as well as a polished research document. The document will focus on the plots and the insights they provide.  

## #4 [Challenge Tasks](challenges)

You will implement and deliver these either with the `Data Organization` and/or `Final Code and Report` deliverable.  

## #5: [Final Presentation](presentation.md)

This will be your **story** -- a verbal presentation of your Data Science results colored by your subjective journey through the project. You will introduce your research topic, provide context and goals. In short, show plots and explain the results. You will have a slide deck that is almost exclusively a collection of the plots that tell a story.
