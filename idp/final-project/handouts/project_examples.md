# Project Examples

This folder contains previous projects that were done for IDP in the 2023-24 school year. You can _pull inspiration_ from these projects, but your final result should **NOT** be a copy of these nor similar to them. They are sectioned off by each step of the project. Note that the requirements are subject to change, and thus these projects may not be an accurate reflection of what work you will have to do.
