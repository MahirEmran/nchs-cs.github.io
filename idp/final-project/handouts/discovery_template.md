### Title

The title should reflect your specific research questions (not just “Intermediate Data Programming Project”).  

---

### Summary of research questions

Give a numbered list of 3 or more research questions and a brief description of what you will investigate. Each research question should have 1–3 sentences and propose something that can be definitively answered, not just a general topic or area of investigation. See the tips on research questions [here](../tips/report#change-the-research-questions)

---

### Motivation

In one or two paragraphs, expand on your research questions by providing context about why you care, or why anyone should care. How does knowing the answers affect the world or our understanding of it?

---

### Datasets

This is the MOST important part of this document. (more details below) You will do the following:

  * Describe the real, existing dataset that you will use, including exact URLs.  
  * You may not use a dataset that has been used in a previous CSE 163 assignment, AP Research work, or competition (TSA, FBLA).  
  * The data must be real — neither you nor someone else may make up the data.  
  * The data must be large enough (500 lines or more).  

You need to list out all your datasets, sources, caveats, important columns, data values, and relevant information. This section should contain multiple tables or other easy to read formats. While you may copy some information from your datasource, it is critical that you understand the data.

You should:  

1. List all datasets  
2. List important columns from each dataset  
3. Examine challenges with the data  

See the [Dataset Example](dataset_example) for more details.

### [Challenge goals](challenges)

  * Select at least 2 challenge goals that you are planning to meet.  
  * Justify why you think this challenge goal is a good fit for your project.
