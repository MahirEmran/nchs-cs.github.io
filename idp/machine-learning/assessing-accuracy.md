# Assessing Accuracy

Learn how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models:

## Performance Metrics
- Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE)
- ROC curves and AUC
- Confusion matrices

## Validation Techniques
- Cross-validation
- Train-test splits
- Holdout sets
- Validation curves

## Common Pitfalls
- Overfitting and underfitting
- Class imbalance
- Data leakage
- Selection bias
