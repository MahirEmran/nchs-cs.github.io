# When to Avoid Using Machine Learning

Understand the limitations and scenarios where machine learning might not be the best solution:

## Common Misconceptions
- The "AI will solve everything" fallacy
- Overcomplicating simple problems
- Ignoring traditional statistical methods
- Misunderstanding data requirements

## Red Flags
- Insufficient data quantity
- Poor data quality
- Lack of domain expertise
- Unrealistic expectations
- High interpretability requirements

## Alternative Approaches
- Rule-based systems
- Statistical analysis
- Simple heuristics
- Traditional algorithms
