# Task List

A template for a task list has been provided for you [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F2ba3ekH2hg-wLWOCXHkyzi8Q8jizi4QHmhfRdichcU/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

This Google Sheets task list template is designed to help students organize and track their tasks effectively. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and guidance on how to use it:

**Purpose of the Task List Template:**

- **Organized Task Management:** The template offers a structured format to list tasks, assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and record time estimates and actuals.

- **Enhanced Productivity:** By clearly outlining tasks and their statuses, students can prioritize their workload and manage time efficiently.

**Understanding the Template Columns:**

1. **Task:** The name or description of the task to be completed.

2. **Owner:** The individual responsible for the task.

3. **Status:** Indicates the current state of the task, such as "Not started," "In progress," or "Completed." Note "Milestone" means it's a weekly goal plan and not specifically something assigned for work. It should not have an initial estimate.

4. **Initial Estimate & Multiplier (Expected Time):** An estimate of the time required to complete the task, which can help in planning and allocation. You put in your estimates here and the Values sheet will apply your estimate multiplier to give your actual expected time.

5. **Week #:** Specifies the week during which the task is scheduled to be worked on or completed.

6. **Actual Time:** The actual amount of time spent on the task, useful for comparing against initial estimates. You can update your time spent against this over time.

7. **User Story ID(s):** References to related user stories or project components, facilitating alignment with broader project goals. You can add another sheet to add your stories and ID's to reference here if needed.

8. **Notes:** Additional comments or observations about the task, such as challenges faced or insights gained.

**How to Use the Template:**

1. **Access the Template:**
   - Open the Google Sheets link provided.
   - To make edits, create your own copy by selecting `File` > `Make a copy`.

2. **Input Tasks:**
   - In the "Task" column, enter each task you need to complete.
   - Assign an "Owner" to each task to denote responsibility.

3. **Update Status:**
   - Regularly update the "Status" column to reflect the current state of each task.

4. **Estimate and Track Time:**
   - Provide an initial time estimate in the "Initial Estimate Multiplier" column.
   - After completing the task, record the actual time spent in the "Actual Time" column to help assess accuracy of estimates and improve future planning.

5. **Schedule Tasks:**
   - Use the "Week #" column to plan when each task should be addressed, aiding in workload distribution over time.

6. **Reference and Note:**
   - Utilize the "User Story ID(s)" column to link tasks to specific project elements.
   - Add any pertinent information or reflections in the "Notes" column to document progress and lessons learned.

By consistently maintaining this task list, students can enhance their organizational skills, ensure accountability, and effectively monitor their progress throughout their academic projects.
