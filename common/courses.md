# NCHS Courses


## AP Computer Science Principles

In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of computing – including problem solving, working with data, understanding the internet, cybersecurity, and programming. Students completing this course should leave with a broadened understanding of computer science for use in diverse majors and careers. Those wanting to earn AP credit will submit two “through-course performance tasks” to the College Board for grading, and will take a multiple-choice end-of-year exam. This course is not a prerequisite for AP Computer Science A, but AP Computer Science A is the logical follow-up class for students inspired to study computer science more deeply after completing this class.

## Web Design

This is a college-level project-based course that introduces the basic elements of designing and developing web pages. Students will learn how to plan and design effective web pages for business and personal use. Web pages will be created using HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap Framework.  This is the perfect course for students who are interested in both computer programming and designing web sites, as students will see their HTML/CSS coding come to life in color and visuals on the webpages they create!
