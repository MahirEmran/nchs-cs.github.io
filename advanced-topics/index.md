# Advanced Topics

This course provides an opportunity for highly motivated students who have completed a year-long college-level Computer Science course (AP Computer Science A) to continue their studies in this field. In this course you will learn about advanced data structures and algorithms, while expanding your knowledge of object-oriented programming. As the year progresses each student will be given increased flexibility to focus more deeply on the topics and technologies that catch and hold their interest.

## Supplemental Information

This course will allow students who have completed the AP computer science course to expand their programming knowledge in a fun group environment. This course has evolved beyond its original design (student-driven, independent projects) into a highly structured class on significant projects. Lessons on software development processes, project design & management, and other topics will assist in completing the projects as well as advance their programming skills. Project design process will be taught to provide a method of better refining ideas and creating effective and useful projects. Students taking this course will be expected to be self-directed and ambitious. These projects will allow students to experience the satisfaction in creating relevant projects of their own design to demonstrate the value and power of computer science.
