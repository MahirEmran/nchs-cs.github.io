subtitle: "Final Project for Advanced Topics"
---

Embarking on a journey of innovation and mastery, Advanced Topics students will have several dedicated weeks to conceive, design, and develop sophisticated Java applications. From intuitive graphical user interfaces to complex algorithms, each project reflects their commitment to excellence and creativity. Join us in exploring these remarkable creations that exemplify the future of technology.

The initial phase of this work will seem slow to most students as it will be several weeks before we get to start coding. That's ok! Larger software projects require more up front planning to avoid having to restart from scratch and throw away a lot of work!

Projects must be approved to assure that they are achievable yet complex enough. Projects must be in Java, no exceptions.   GUI applications are preferred. Console is okay if sufficiently complex.

##  <a name='Timeline'></a>Timeline 2025

You will have approximately X weeks to complete your final project. 

We will start on the final project after Tic Tac Toe. Assume earliest start would be **week 12** (2025-03-16). We have at most until **week 24** to complete all activities; which will be 12 weeks.

Your task **must** have weekly goals. You can update these each week but the initial version will remain in your Project Proposal.

## <a name='Learnings'></a>Learning Journal

Add to your github doc folder (if not there) a `learnings.md` document with the information below.

* Update your learnings in your markdown document
* Write down what you’ve learned (at least weekly)
* You’ll present this in the formal presentation

### Examples

| Date | What |
| --- | --- |
| XX | Became proficient with Maps of Lists |
| XX | Got much better with Inner Anonymous Classes for customized events| 
| XX | Learned about PriorityQueue and when that is useful| 
| XX | Learned how compressed air particles are represented with sound waves| 
| XX | Learned how to insert nodes into a specific spot in a Tree|
| XX | Discovered that some of the most elusive bugs, once found, are easy to fix!|


_Each learning needs to relate to a specific experience and/or section of code. Be ready to elaborate if asked._
