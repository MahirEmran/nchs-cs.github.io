# Project Description

This description will vary in length and detail. It could be as short as 4 sentences, or as long as 4 pages. Target about 2-4 paragraphs long. Describe what the project does with enough detail that another developer could implement the project for you and get it pretty close. Sections below will allow another developer to get it very close!

**Describe MVP** (Minimum Viable Product). Describe the absolute fewest pieces of functionality that defines success. If any part of an MVP feature is missing, the project is not worth shipping and is considered a failure. This is not necessarily your target set of functionality. It should describe the set of features you’re confident you can get done on time.

Stretch Features: List the features that are bonus and completely unnecessary. These will be added only as time permits.

# Learning Targets and Challenge Goals

What do you need to know to be successful?  What technology or techniques are new to you that are likely to be difficult? What will you exercise and get better at because of this project? Bulleted list goes here.  You can list out Data Structures, Generics, and/or Interfaces that you intend to become more familiar with. List out algorithms and/or public libraries List out GUI components or things like: multi-threading, security, web services, GitHub, sound, Fast Fourier Transforms, double buffering, image processing, fly out menus, Trees, networking  Cannot say vague things like, “To learn how to code the project” |

# Deliverables

This is an ordered list of major pieces of functionality created in an intentional order to help you incrementally create a larger project that works. Each deliverable is a significant piece of functionality that should be completed before the next deliverable starts. While it is often true that one deliverable must be delivered before another can be accomplished, deliverables do not have to have dependencies on one another. This means that two deliverables can be developed in parallel by different members of a team.

Recall how we developed projects during the first semester. The table below is an **example** set of deliverables for the Shunting Yard GUI calculator. You should replace it with your own set of deliverables.

Oftentimes we will discover more deliverables along the way. This is fine. It is difficult (sometimes impossible) to know everything at the start of a project. Discovered work will be added to the Task Worksheet.

| Deliverable | Notes |
| :---- | :---- |
| A GUI with functional buttons and text display (provided for you) | No calculations necessary. Event handlers hooked up. |
| Event handlers implemented basic calculator functionality. | No order of operations. Changes display with calculated values. |
| Post-Fix evaluator class that calculates the value of an expression in post-fix. | Unit Tests included. Uses Stacks/Queues. |
| Shunting yard class that implements the algorithm to convert in-fix to post-fix. | Unit Tests included. Uses Stacks/Queues. |
| Full Shunting Yard Calculator. | All components are integrated together to make a fully functional calculator. |
| Extra operators. | If time, more buttons and operations are added. Example: modulus, square root, log, exponentiation.  |

# High Level Architecture

This section will most likely be hard to create.   
Then, ask yourself, “What is the difficult part about the project? How will I solve that problem?” If there is nothing difficult about the project, then the project may not be complex enough. If you don’t know how to solve the problem, ask, “How will I learn to solve that problem?” Explain all of that here.

Lastly, consider what classes you will create, their roles & responsibilities, how your classes will interface with one another, where data will come from, and what data structures will be used. If there are lots of data sources and paths, making a diagram can help add clarity. Many projects will not require a Data Flow Diagram.

## Class Roles & Responsibilities

Start with defining a few classes and their roles & responsibilities. It could be that that will be enough. If you cannot list off at least three classes, the project is not complex enough.
